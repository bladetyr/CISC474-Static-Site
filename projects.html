    <!--COOL PROJECT STUFF-->
    <h2 class="projHeader">SAGE</h2>
    <div>
	<p>Sage is a bot created for the University of Delaware Computer Science Discord server. It is currently updated, maintained, and managed by a team of 4 hired undergraduate students. The tech stack includes Typescript, MongoDB, and DiscordJS (v13 -> v14).
        <br><br>
        We service over 25 professors and 3,000+ students. I have worked on this team for several years now and we work closely with UD faculty to create new features for Sage. Additionally, I am paid to moderate and manage the Discord server.
        <br><br>
        You can read up on Sage on <a href="https://ud-cis-discord.github.io/">our site</a> as well as see our source code on <a href="https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/Sage">our GitHub repo</a>.

    <h2 class="projHeader">BOOTH'S ALGORITHM CALCULATOR</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
        Created a booth's algorithm calculator in C without using the bit-shift operator. All conversions to binary and any arithmetic are done manually. It was also co-created by <a href="https://github.com/englandz">Zachary England</a>.
        <br><br>
        You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/bladetyr/BoothAlgCalc">here</a>.

    <h2 class="projHeader">CPU SCHEDULER SIMULATOR</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
        This was a C++ project made for my operating systems class. I cannot link the source code since the instructor still uses this assignment, but the goal of it was to round robin schedule tasks as they came in, have the tasks 'run' (it didn't run the tasks since it is a simulator, it just used time to determine when tasks were done), and then continue scheduling based on new tasks coming in.
        <br><br>It was a very informative project that made me realize how much I love systems, so I wanted to include it on this list! Feel free to ask about it, even if I cannot post source code publically.

    <h2 class="projHeader">PERSONAL BLOG SITE</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
        You found my blog site! I mostly made this for fun, but I'm going to try to update it with the stuff I'm up to from time to time. The link is <a href="https://bladetyr.neocities.org">here</a>
        <br><br>
        It is currently hosted on Neocities for nostalgia factor. The tech stack is plain HTML/CSS and JS. The themes can be swapped if the default is too bright for you.
        <br><br>
